# Tailscale Remote Access Guide  
> A simple, secure, and zero-config approach to access an internal server from anywhere — without public IP, port forwarding, or VPS.

This guide helps you connect to a private/internal server (e.g., home server, lab machine, on-prem machine) from **any external network** using **Tailscale**, a free and encrypted virtual private network that supports automatic NAT traversal.

---

## 🚀 Features

- No need for public IP  
- No need for port forwarding  
- No need for VPS  
- Works behind NAT / firewall  
- End-to-end encrypted mesh network  
- Free for personal use  
- Access your server from anywhere (SSH, Jupyter, Web UI, APIs)

# 1. Install Tailscale on the Internal Server

Run the following script to install Tailscale:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
````

Start the Tailscale service:

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

This command will output a login link such as:

```
https://login.tailscale.com/a/xxxxxxx
```

Open the link in your browser and log in (Google / GitHub / Microsoft supported).

---

# 2. Verify Server Connection

Check your Tailscale-assigned IP:

```bash
tailscale ip
```

Expected output (example):

```
100.120.55.34
fd7a:115c:a1e0:ab12:abcd:abcd:abcd:1234
```

The IPv4 address (`100.x.x.x`) is the one you'll use to remotely access the server.

---

# 3. Install Tailscale on Your Client Device

Install on the external device you want to use for remote access:

| Platform   | Download URL                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows    | [https://tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) |
| macOS      | [https://tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) |
| Linux      | Use same install script                                          |
| Android    | Google Play: *Tailscale*                                         |
| iOS/iPadOS | App Store: *Tailscale*                                           |

Login with the **same** Tailscale account used on the server.

Once logged in, you should see your internal server listed in the Tailscale dashboard.

---

# 4. SSH Into the Internal Server (From Any Network)

Use the Tailscale IP obtained earlier:

```bash
ssh <username>@100.120.55.34
```

Congratulations — you are now inside your internal server from an external network, without any VPN configuration or port forwarding.

---

# 5. Optional: Automatically Start Tailscale on Boot

Enable the Tailscale daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tailscaled
sudo systemctl restart tailscaled
```

---

# 6. Access Other Services (Jupyter / Web UI / APIs)

If your internal server hosts local web services:

| Local Service | Local Address                                  | Remote (Tailscale)                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| JupyterLab    | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | [http://100.x.x.x:8888](http://100.x.x.x:8888) |
| TensorBoard   | [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) | [http://100.x.x.x:6006](http://100.x.x.x:6006) |
| Custom API    | [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) | [http://100.x.x.x:5000](http://100.x.x.x:5000) |

No reverse proxy, no firewall edits — Tailscale handles the secure routing automatically.

---

# 7. Security Enhancement (Optional)

Restrict SSH to accept **only Tailscale network connections**:

1. Find your Tailscale IP (`100.x.x.x`)
2. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
ListenAddress 100.120.55.34
```

3. Restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

This ensures your SSH port is not exposed to the physical LAN or WAN, but only to authenticated Tailscale peers.

---

# 8. Troubleshooting

### ✔ Tailscale command not found

Run installation script again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

### ✔ Cannot access web services

Make sure the service is bound to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`
(e.g., Jupyter needs `--ip 0.0.0.0`).

---

# 9. Summary

Tailscale enables:

* Private, secure access to internal servers
* Zero configuration NAT traversal
* Seamless multi-device connectivity
* Stronger security than traditional VPN

This method is ideal for:

* Home labs
* University lab servers
* On-prem GPU servers
* NAS / Raspberry Pi / Linux servers
* Developers who need remote access without exposing ports

# 🙌 如果你愿意，我还能帮你：

- 生成 **中文版 README**  
- 为 GitHub 仓库自动生成目录（TOC）  
- 分离成多文件文档（/docs/install.md, /docs/ssh.md）  
- 添加 Markdown 图示（架构拓扑图，例如：外网→Tailscale→内网服务器）  
- 美化 README（徽章、横幅、动画截图）

需要我继续扩展吗？
```
